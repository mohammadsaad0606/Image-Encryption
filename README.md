# Image Encryption using Chaotic Maps
Overview
This Python-based desktop application provides a simple yet effective image encryption and decryption tool using chaotic maps. The implemented chaotic maps include the Arnold map, Baker map, and Logistic map. Users can encrypt their digital images and later decrypt them to obtain the original image using the reverse process.

Features
Image Encryption: Utilize chaotic maps to encrypt digital images.
Image Decryption: Reverse the encryption process to obtain the original image.
Support for Different Chaotic Maps: Choose between Arnold map, Baker map, and Logistic map for encryption.

How to Use

Encryption Process:
Select the image you want to encrypt.
Choose the chaotic map for encryption.
Click the "Encrypt" button to generate the encrypted image.

Decryption Process:
Select the encrypted image you want to decrypt.
Choose the same chaotic map used for encryption.
Click the "Decrypt" button to obtain the original image.
